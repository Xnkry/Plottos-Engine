Since you are in your `plotter` directory in the fish shell, run these commands to update the README:

1.  **Create the Image Folder:**
    `mkdir -p assets`
2.  **Move your screenshot:** Move your image into the `assets` folder and name it `showcase.jpg`.
3.  **Update README:** Open `README.md` in VS Code, paste the content above, and save it.
4.  **Push to GitHub:**
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "docs: finalize professional README with user guide and showcase image"
